# Bias-Aware Medical AI (BAM-AI)

## Problem Statement
AI-driven healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes, but biases in training data can lead to misdiagnoses, unequal treatment, and ethical concerns. A lack of transparency in AI decision-making further risks compromising patient trust and fairness.

This hackathon challenges participants to develop AI solutions that ensure equitable healthcare by integrating diverse datasets, implementing bias mitigation strategies, and enhancing transparency.

## Proposed AI Solution
Our *Bias-Aware Medical AI (BAM-AI)* framework ensures fairness in AI-driven healthcare through:

1. *Diverse & Representative Data* – Training AI on inclusive datasets to reduce bias.
2. *Bias Detection & Mitigation* – Implementing fairness-aware algorithms and continuous auditing.
3. *Explainable AI (XAI)* – Enhancing transparency with interpretable decision-making.
4. *Ethical Compliance* – Aligning with healthcare regulations for responsible AI deployment.

This solution promotes equitable healthcare, mitigates bias, and enhances trust in AI-powered medical systems while prioritizing patient well-being.

## Impact of the Solution
Our *Bias-Aware Medical AI (BAM-AI)* framework enhances fairness, transparency, and trust in AI-driven healthcare by:

- *Ensuring Equitable Access* – Reducing bias for fairer diagnoses and treatments.
- *Enhancing Trust & Transparency* – Providing explainable AI-driven medical decisions.
- *Maintaining Regulatory Compliance* – Aligning with healthcare standards (HIPAA, GDPR).
- *Enabling Continuous Improvement* – Implementing real-time monitoring and bias mitigation.

This solution fosters ethical, inclusive, and accountable AI in healthcare, prioritizing patient well-being.

## Previous Results
During our AI & Data Science Codeathon at IIIT Bangalore, presented by RBI and Canara Bank, our team developed *Veda 1.0*, an AI & Data Science model that provided:
- *Risk Prediction*
- *Credit Score Calculation*
- *Eligibility Checks*
- *Feedback System*
- *24x7 Support*
- *Loan Application Guidelines & Scheme Recommendations*

These experiences have guided the development of BAM-AI, ensuring a robust, fair, and transparent AI-driven healthcare solution.

## Future Scope
- Expanding the dataset for better bias mitigation.
- Implementing federated learning for data privacy.
- Enhancing the explainability of AI decisions.
- Integrating with existing hospital systems.
